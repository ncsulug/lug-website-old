<h2>Registration Info</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Registration is restricted to members of the LUG. If you have shown
        up to more than one meeting (or you hang out in our IRC channel
        literally <em>all</em> the time), congratulations, you're a member!
    </li>
    <li>
        Before your account is activated, the LUG officers will check to
        make sure that (a) we know who you are, and (b) you are not a bot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you have registered, we'll give you your username. It is
        autogenerated from your nickname by lowercasing and removing
        any characters Django doesn't like. (So Sha`Bren becomes shabren.)
    </li>
</ul>
